bhp_netbook links to bhp_hbc. If you have an initial_data.json, be sure 
to dumpdata the fixture for bhp_hbc as well. Same goes for loaddata.

See bhp_hbc README for information on dumpdata and loaddata for bhp_hbc

After bhp_hbc, update bhp_netbook, 

# dumpdata
python manage.py dumpdata bhp_netbook > bhp_hbc/fixtures/initial_data.json

# loaddata
python manage.py loaddata bhp_netbook/fixtures/initial_data.json

# Commit to svn
svn ci bhp_netbook/fixtures/initial_data.json -m "update fixtures"
